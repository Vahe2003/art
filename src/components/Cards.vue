Young Paruyr attended the village school and later in 1940 moved to Yerevan to study at the philological faculty of Yerevan State University. He graduated from the YSU in 1945. The same year he starts a postgraduate study of Armenian literature at the Academy of Sciences Abeghyan Institute of Literature.In 1951 Sevak went to Moscow to study at the Gorky Institute of World Literature.Graduating from that institute Paruyr works there in 1957-59 as a translating professor.
            Inspired by the Western Armenian poet Ruben Sevak, Paruyr Ghazaryan adopted the name Paruyr Sevak as his pen name.
            In 1960 Sevak returns to Yerevan and starts his fecund and meaningful literary, scientific and public activism. He starts to work at the Abeghyan Institute of Literature as a scientific researcher.From 1966-1971 Sevak served as the Secretary of the Board of the Writers Union of Armenia.
            In 1967 Sevak became a doctor of philology after dissertation defense. In 1968 he was elected to the Supreme Council of the Armenian SSR.
            Sevak died on June 17, 1971 in a car crash while on a drive back to Yerevan. In previous years, he had voiced his criticism of the corruption of the Soviet establishment and for this, many Armenians believe, he was murdered by the Soviet government. His wife, Nelly Menagharishvili, also died in the car crash. He was buried in the backyard of his home, in Zangakatun, which later became a museum open to everyone.

              Hovhannes Tumanyan (February 19 [O.S. February 7] 1869 – March 23, 1923) was an Armenian poet, writer, translator, literary and public activist. He is considered the national poet of Armenia.
              Tumanyan wrote poems, quatrains, ballads, novels, fables, critical and journalistic articles. His work was mostly written in realistic form, often centering on everyday life of his time. Born in the historical village of Dsegh in the Lori region, at a young age Tumanyan moved to Tiflis, which was the center of Armenian culture under the Russian Empire during the 19th and early 20th centuries.
              Tumanyan's work is simple, natural and poetically inspired at the same time. It is not by mere chance that dozens of phrases and expressions from Tumanyan's works have become a natural part of people's everyday language, their sayings, adages, and maxims.He created lyrics, fables, epic poems and translations into Armenian of Byron, Goethe and Pushkin.

            We have many prominent films about the war, where there is no war scene, and instead, there is the spirit of war. The most influential is “The song of the old days.” The heroes of the film are members of the provincial city theatre team who shares the bitterness and suffering of the victims with the whole country.
            The film focuses on the woman named Hayastan, who loses all her five sons during the war, and Nikol who brings the “black paper” about the death of her sons. The film is so touching that even the most cold-hearted person can’t watch without crying. The director of the film is Albert Mkrtchyan, who was the witness of the war.
            Armenian old films are considered to be one of the valuable treasures for us, which have essential meaning for our national identity. Our old movies are not limited only to these six ones. There are numerous Armenian old films, which are loved by the Armenians and not only. Other treasures are Namus, Pepo, Guys from the Army Band, The Color of Pomegranates, We and Our Mountains, Ararat. It is just impossible to mention all of it, as it seems to be unlimited.
